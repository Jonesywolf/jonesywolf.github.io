  summary:
    "I'll never forget the smell of burning circuit boards‚Äîor the lesson it taught me.\nIn preparation for the launch of my first business, Progetto Company, I was manufacturing my first batch of circuit boards in my parents' basement. Having never reflowed solder on a hot plate before, I accidentally \"overcooked\" all 24, melting the solder mask and ruining the batch. While that failure stung, it taught me valuable lessons about perseverance, problem-solving, and learning through experience‚Äîprinciples that have shaped my journey ever since.\nThrough various mechanical, electrical, and software projects‚Äîwhether for school, my business, or three engineering internships‚ÄîI've learned (and failed) a lot. These experiences have solidified my passion for mechatronics and robotics engineering, blending the best of mechanical, electrical, and software domains. It‚Äôs this intersection that inspired me to pursue a degree in Robotics Engineering at the University of Toronto.\nI hope my engineering experiences inside and outside work continue to cater to this multidisciplinary interest and encourage me to keep learning new things. Whether you‚Äôve got an idea to share, a project to tackle, or some circuit boards to ‚Äútoast‚Äù, shoot me a message‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to chat!",

        "To market some of my products I created a simple Arduino calculator with basic arithmetic operators and support for numbers with decimals. However, this calculator does have other limitations, to simplify the code, this calculator evaluates the result from left to right, without regard for the order of operations. It also has no support for negative numbers. Be sure to see the video demo.",
